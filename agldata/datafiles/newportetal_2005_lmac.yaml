# The strings sets originate from: Newport, Conway, C. M., & Christiansen, M. H. (2005). Modality-constrained
# statistical learning of tactile, visual, and auditory sequences. Journal of Experimental Psychology:
# Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 31(1), 24. Experiment 1

# Same stimuli was used in Conway, C. M., & Christiansen, M. H. (2009). Seeing and hearing in space
# and time: Effects of modality and presentation rate on implicit statistical learning. European
# Journal of Cognitive Psychology, 21(4), 561-580.

# The grammar is based upon the same structure as Gomez and Gerken (1999)

# They didn't not use sounds or pictures but electric stimulation to the fingers.
# In experiments 1b & 1c the electric stimulation was replaced by pictures and sounds respectively
# the grammar rules and stimuli were the same

# during habituation pairs were use
# a pair existed either out twice the same string or slight differences between the two strings.

# a mismatch pair consisted of two strings that were present in two pairs, a string in a matched pair only
# appeared in that pair.

# discrimination between the two string was not recorded and the ony purpose was that the participant was paying attention

# both strings in each pair were in line with the grammar.
