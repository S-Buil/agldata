Contributing
------------

To add data from studies or to fix bugs/add functionality, it is best to
use the Github pull request workflow. It is described here:
https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Contributing-to-Processing-with-Pull-Requests

To add studies, you create a text file in YAML format following the a `mock example here
<https://github.com/gbeckers/agldata/tree/master/agldata/datafiles/mockexample
.yaml>`__ and place it in the 'datafiles' directory.
